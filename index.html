            <p class = "adnan-text">WE’RE CARRIED BY TORNADOES WE BARELY NOTICE, WHIRLWINDS WE BARELY FEEL, AGGRESSIONS WE BARELY ACKNOWLEDGE, BECAUSE WE’RE HALF AWAKE.</p> 
            
            <p class="personal-text">What does it mean to be fully, deeply awake?</p>

            <p class="adnan-text"> OUR HOUSES ARE CLUTTERED, OUR MINDS TOO, SO A FIRE AS DEVASTATING AS IT CAN BE, CAN WELL CLEAR THE AIR. ENLARGE THE SPACE, MAKE ROOM FOR SOME SILENCE.</p>

            <p class="personal-text">In the silence, what flows below the hum of your wandering mind? What emerges when you let the light in, in the spaces that inner silence creates? 
            </p>

            <p class="adnan-text"> IN SILENCE, IN THE DARK, THE TIDES SHINE, GET SLIPPERY, THEIR FLUIDITY TURNS THEM INTO A MIRAGE. THERE’S A PERSISTENT HUM TO THE OCEAN THAT TRANSLATES INTO A BACK-AND-FORTH MOVEMENT OF OUR BODY.
            </p>

            <p class="personal-text">Breathe in, breathe out. Follow the tide of your breath, the steady inhalation and exhalation of oxygen that connects you to your body, to this moment, to this life. 
            </p>

            <p class="adnan-text"> THE UNIVERSE MAKES A SOUND—IS A SOUND. IN THE CORE OF THIS SOUND THERE’S A SILENCE, A SILENCE THAT CREATES THAT SOUND, WHICH IS NOT ITS OPPOSITE, BUT ITS INSEPERABLE SOUL. AND THIS SILENCE CAN ALSO BE HEARD. 
            </p>

            <p class="personal-text last-line">You are invited to enter the room in front of you. Remove your shoes and sit on the cushion in a comfortable position. Breathe in, breathe out.
            </p>

            <p class="personal-text last-line">In the sound, find the silence.</p>
